# Advanced_CPP_Course

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the ISSP course at the University of Wroc≈Çaw.
Throughout the course, we focused on C++ standards 14, 17, and 20, covering topics such as creating a custom vector class, using metaprogramming, working with concepts, and implementing multithreading.
